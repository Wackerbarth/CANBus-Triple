# Note: Some projects place entries here to exclude artifacts
# generated by the Editor or Compilers (for example, "*.o")
# Within the git structure, those entries are needed because those
# ancillary or derived files should NOT appear in a source repository.
# However, this is NOT the place for tose entries. You should place
# them in your global ignore file rather than in a per-project
# file such as this. See http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# The automatic versioning scheme generates and maintains
# the following file. NEVER put it in the repository
